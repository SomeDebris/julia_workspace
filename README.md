# julia_workspace
dumping julia code i use to do my homework. problem-specific usually.

## this is probably useless to you.

Im using this because:
- you can see the work that i've done, if for some reason you need it.
- I need to use it on multiple computers.

yeah. 

if this ends up being useful, then cool! but also extremely surprising!!
