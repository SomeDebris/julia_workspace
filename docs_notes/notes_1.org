#+TITLE: Julia documentation notes
* Introduction:
- Julia is a high-performance language (approaching C) that tries to look like a
  "slow dynamic language" (python).
- Read through "Performance tips" if your thing is slow. Julia's speed is a little
  different than things you're probably used to. It can become as fast as C!
- Julia uses some unique tech (e.g. JIT, uses LLVM), has pretty equations like
  matlab, python, and R, but is more general. Tries to combine dynamic languages
  with maths.
- Uniquely, in Julia, types are inferred but can also be declared.
- The core feature of Julia is that functions are defined by the differing types
  of their arguments. The "best choice" function is the one that's actually run
  when the function is called. Thats "Multiple Dispatch" for ya. Differs from
  "Object Oriented Dispatch", as the type of arguments used in an operation
  can change how it behaves.
- Julia was designed to be performant, even though it's dynamic. This is unusual
  and is why you may want to use this language.
